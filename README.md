## Knowledge Base

Our approach to resolve AERs that are attached to unresolved topologies based on a knowledge base is outlined in the following:

## Knowledge Base Model

The knowledge base is structured an centered around multiple taxonomies (Middleware, Infrastructure, Supplementware, etc.) to categorize the solutions and implementations it contains:
